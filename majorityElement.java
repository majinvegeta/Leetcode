/* Approach 2 - Boyer - Moore voting algorithm
Think of it as a game, where many groups are fighting for the throne. Each group has
its own army. Any soldier can kill other groupâ€™s soldier only by suicidal attack.
Now no matter who ever fights with whom, or how it starts, the one with more than 
half will always win. In worst half case, every group is aiming for the biggest group
 and nobody wins.
 FYI, if we aren't sure if a majority element exists...check if the frequency of the
 candidate is greater than floor(n/2).
